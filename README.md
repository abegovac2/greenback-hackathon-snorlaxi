### There are a few things that we would like to address:
- This is `the first version` of our MVP when it comes to application design. After the meetings with our mentors, we decided to leave the
  design and functionality as it is, and improve our business model and design in Figma.
- We would like in the near time to improve our solution to match the Figma design located on this page: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pWcyahqac0sMK4weP6MuM73dm5ursmlP/view?usp=sharing
- Current solution architecture is scalable, we also provide a document on how we plan to scale our solution and architecture: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q4Gyk1PfKIlTGjJzEC_IzqCK5rVwYX8w/view?usp=sharing


### To run our solution locally, please follow the next steps. 
NOTE: Make sure you have React Native and Expo installed globally, if not here is how you do it: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
- Navigate to the root folder of our solution, then type in the terminal:
```
npm install
npm start
```

That's all that you need to run our solution locally.
